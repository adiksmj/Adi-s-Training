  <h1>Block Scope</h1>

<p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.</br>

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.</br>

  These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.</br>

  Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:</br>

Example</p>
<pre>{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here</pre>

<p>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</br>

  Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.</br>

  Example</p>
<pre>{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here</pre>
