<p>new Date(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond (in that order))</br>
(Note: JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11.
January is 0. December is 11.)</p>
<h2>JavaScript new Date()</h2>

<p>Using new Date(7 numbers), creates a new date object with the specified date and time:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30, 0);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = d;
</script>

</body>
</html>


note: You cannot omit month. If you supply only one parameter it will be treated as milliseconds.
