<p>"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

The "use strict" Directive</br>
The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.</br>

It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.</br>

The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".</br>

  With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.</br>

All modern browsers support "use strict" except Internet Explorer 9 and lower:</p>
<h2>With "use strict":</h2>
<h3>Using a variable without declaring it, is not allowed.</h3>

<p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>

&quot;use strict&quot;;

&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<script>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;  // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
</script>
