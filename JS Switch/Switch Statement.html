The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

Example 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript switch</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let day;
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case  6:
    day = "Saturday";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Today is " + day;
</script>

</body>
</html>
